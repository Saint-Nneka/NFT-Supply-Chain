##  1. <a name='Introduction'></a>Introduction

Counterfeiting is a major challenge that most manufacturers are faced with. In the pharmaceutical industry, this problem is punctuated by the associated health hazards. Serious as that is, counterfeiting is just one among these other ailments of the pharmaceutical  supply chain; poor inventory management, data loss, theft and more. The complexity of the pharmaceutical sector, which is due to heavy regulation and strict guidelines, makes it difficult to ensure that drugs are authentic, safe, and effective. However, the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in product tracking could be the light at the end of the pharmaceutical supply chain tunnel.  NFTs offer unique benefits in terms of traceability, transparency, and security, making them an attractive option for pharmaceutical companies looking for the best way to monitor the movement of drugs from production to consumption. This article explores the benefits, stakeholders, revenue model, and challenges of tracking a pharmaceutical product from when it is manufactured to when it gets to the hands of the consumer.

Since NFTs represent unique and immutable digital assets that cannot be replicated, modified, or duplicated,  They can be used to provide a secure and tamper-proof digital record of a product's journey from the manufacturer to the end consumer. With this, one can be sure that the data associated with the drug's journey through the supply chain is accurate and reliable, providing transparency and accountability to all parties involved. This system is critical for ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs and mitigating the risks associated with counterfeit or substandard medicines. Thus, the benefits of NFTs in the tracking of the pharmaceuticals include: 

**Provenance and Traceability.** Each NFT is unique and can be assigned to a specific drug product, allowing for real-time tracking of the drug as it moves from manufacturer to distributor to pharmacy. This can help prevent heavy loss for the pharmaceutical company, and therapeutic failures/hazards in patients due to diversion and drug counterfeiting respectively.

T**Transparency and accountability**. Because the custody of these records is not committed to human imperfection but to the sophistication of blockchain security, it is virtually impossible to alter or tamper with, or even lose the associated data. This means that all parties involved in the supply chain can have confidence in the authenticity of the data, reducing the risk of fraud or error 

**Ownership tracking.** With NFT-enabled traceability, the end user of a pharmaceutical product can be determined. Regulators can, therefore, adopt the use of NFTs to prevent the abuse of controlled substances.

**Automation.** The smart contracts for each NFT can be used to automate various aspects of the supply chain. For example, a smart contract could be created that automatically releases payment to the manufacturer once the drugs have been verified as authentic and have been received by the distributor.

**Airdrops.** Certain challenges may necessitate rapid dissemination of information. This is true in the case of product recall or counterfeit alert.. With NFTs, this can be rapidly done by sending an airdrop to every holder of the recall product/batch token.

![Stakeholders of the pharmaceutical supply chain](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvwkqsotl/image/upload/v1684234162/NFT%20supply%20chain/Stakeholders_of_the_pharmaceutical_supply_chain_zoaww3.png)

The tracking of pharmaceuticals using NFTs entails creating a digital record of each drug's journey through the supply chain. This process involves several key stakeholders, including manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, consumers, and regulators. As such, it is important to understand the roles of each stakeholder.

**Manufacturers** are the first stakeholders in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Since they are responsible for production, their role in tracking is to provide the production details for every manufactured batch of products. Such information as are required here includes the drug's name, batch number, expiration date, inspection certificate ID, and other relevant data. These production details form the basics of the metadata that is written into the smart contract of the NFTs for each batch or product (as the case may be). And the tracking begins.

**Distributors** are the next stakeholders in the tracking. They are responsible for transporting the drugs from the manufacturer to various points of sale. Their primary goal in executing their function is to ensure that the product gets to the pharmacy without being damaged, lost, or compromised in any way. Here is how this can be ensured using NFTs. Distributors can sign a custodian agreement in an NFT smart contract to show what product and the quantity of each product they have in custody. This information, as well as the real-time mapping and storage updates, gets dynamically updated to the associated batch metadata. 

**The community or hospital pharmacies** are the next to receive these products that have been in transit since after production. On getting to the pharmacy, authenticity, and storage data can be verified from the NFT metadata, and a change of custody consensus would update the products distribution record. 

**Consumers, administrators, and health assistants** are the end-users of pharmaceuticals. Their role is to simply scan-to-verify the QR on the product, which redirects them to the metadata. An end-user who unseals a product could also collect the associated NFT, and by so doing, make a final update to indicate that the product is sold out.

**The regulators** are also an important set of stakeholders in the supply chain process. They are responsible for ensuring that products are safe, effective, and meet regulatory requirements. Regulators may request access to the NFTs to verify the authenticity of drugs and confirm that they have been properly manufactured and transported. Regulators may also use NFTs to track adverse events and monitor the safety of drugs over time.


##  4. <a name='RevenuemodelsforNFTsupplychaintrackingofpharmaceuticals.'></a>Revenue models for NFT supply chain tracking of pharmaceuticals.

In a pharmaceutical supply chain setting, revenue for NFT-tracking products can be derived from various sources.

One of the primary revenue streams for NFT supply chain tracking lies in the `creation and issuance of NFTs`. Companies can offer services to pharmaceutical industries, enabling them to tokenize their products and create NFTs that represent the unique identity and history of each batch or item. This process involves capturing relevant data, such as origin, manufacturing details, and regulatory certificates, and associating it with the NFT. 
Moreso, because NFTs provide an immutable record of asset authenticity, regulators of pharmaceuticals can begin to offer services such as verifying the accuracy of the data associated with NFTs, conducting audits, or issuing certificates of authenticity. Revenue can be generated through `service fees or per-audit charges`.
Additionally, NFT supply chain tracking requires seamless integration with existing supply chain systems and processes. Businesses (such as those that are knowledgeable of hyper-ledger technology) can offer `consultation and integration services`, helping companies adopt NFT technology and ensuring compatibility with their current infrastructure. Revenue can be generated through consultancy fees, implementation charges, and ongoing maintenance contracts.
Furthermore, the abundance of data generated by NFT supply chain tracking presents an opportunity to `offer data analytics and insights service`s. By analyzing the vast pool of supply chain data, big pharma can identify trends, optimize processes, and detect inefficiencies that could give them a competitive advantage.
Finally, building an `NFT marketplace` can act as a hub for consumers to showcase their NFT collections. Revenue can be generated through transaction fees, listing fees, or even exclusive tours of the production plant. 

##  5. <a name='ChallengesofNFTSupplyChainTracking'></a>Challenges of NFT Supply Chain Tracking

While NFTs offer significant benefits for supply chain tracking in the pharmaceutical industry, there are also several challenges to implementation. Here are some of them;

*The cost of implementation.* Because NFTs require blockchain technology, which can be complex and expensive to set up and maintain, implementing an NFT-based system can require significant investment. This is particularly true for large-scale pharmaceutical supply chains, where many NFTs need to be created and managed.

*Interoperability.* The integration of a blockchain NFT system with other supply chain management systems can be really challenging. This can create issues when it comes to sharing data with other stakeholders in the supply chain.

*Standardization.* NFTs are a relatively new technology, and there are currently no industry standards for their use in pharmaceutical supply chain tracking. This can create issues when it comes to interoperability and data sharing..

*Adoption:* The adoption of NFTs in the pharmaceutical industry will require buy-in from all stakeholders in the supply chain. This can be difficult to achieve, particularly if some stakeholders are resistant to change.

Be that as it may, enlightenment transcends all challenges. In terms of cost, a projected analysis of the risk/benefit ratio may inform an adoption decision irrespective of the heavy financial requirements. The rest of the challenges -Interoperability, standardization, and adoption - can also be overcome by proper education and trials.

##  6. <a name='Conclusion.'></a>Conclusion.

So far, we have seen how an NFT supply chain tracking system can revolutionize the way we interact with the production, distribution, regulation, and authentication of pharmaceuticals. The advantages of such implementation ranges from provenance to accountability and rapid product recall possibilities via airdrops. However, stakeholders of the pharmaceutical supply chain must play their roles for this NFT based integration that promises different streams of revenue to have the chance for massive adoption. Lastly, as with any new technology, there are expected to be challenges with the NFT supply chain. But the good news is that each of the challenges is resolved to the degree that the actors are enlightened on the subject.  So, by adopting an NFT tracking system, we can ensure that the pharmaceutical supply chain process is transparent, traceable, compliant, and authentic.
